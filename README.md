2.       Nancy Freehafer was the best performing salesperson of the year, followed closely by Ann Larsen. Jason Kotas was the poorest performing sales representative of the year 2014.
3.       Coffee is the best performing product, whereas beer is the least performing product.
 
RECOMMENDATIONS
1.       The company could identify some techniques that it used to enhance sales in the top best performing months and apply them regularly, going forward. Such methods could be active advertising and top-notch customer service.
2.       Nancy could be promoted to go supervise the least performing region (West) and see if she could help the region improve its sales revenue. Meanwhile, Jason could be considered for an efficient sales training program that could help him catch up with others. He could also use counseling to check whether he's personal life is affecting his work, thereby, help him on way forward.
3.       More coffee could be sold in the lesser performing regions to up the overall sales of the company. Discount prices and such offers could be used to move more sales of the beer product. Moreover, a survey could be done to acquire customer feedback on what could be causing the disparity in the sales of the various products and make strategic decisions based on that feedback.
